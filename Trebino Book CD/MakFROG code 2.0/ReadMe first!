Before you get started with makFROG 2.0:written by Marco A. Krumbuegel, March 11, 2002Copy this folder on your harddisk to install the program!The program might contain bugs that I didn't catch.  Please let me know if you find any, so that I can fix them in the next version (maktech@earthlink.net).I never tried the program on other machines than Apple Macs with System 7.5, 8.0,or 9.1.The program requires by default 6 MByte free memory.  This is not enough, however, if you want to use 512 x 512 pixel FROG traces; these need at least 16 MByte.  Ifthe program needs more than the allocated memory, the program will first display a warning message and then quit; see "Memory requirements" in the "Help" menu for details.Do not delete or modify any of the six *.sys files that come with the program!Please read the stuff in the Help menues to find out more about the program!The program comes with four demo files:"SHG-FROG.demo" is an experimental SHG-FROG trace from the Stanford 														free-electron laser.  The data is very noise, so it's														a good example to try out noise filters.														The experimental parameters are														Number of time delays:  64														Wavelength points:         64														Center wavelength:        2568.9 nm														Wavelength increment:  0.6 nm														Delay increment:           169.44 fs"CSN-FROG.demo" is an experimental PG-FROG trace recorded using a               cascaded second-order nonlinearity.  It's a good example 			            for a large FROG trace. The experimental parameters are														Number of time delays:  64														Wavelength points:         802														Center wavelength:        850 nm														Wavelength increment:  -0.09 nm														Delay increment:           21.348 fs"ReadIn.demo"  is a numerically calculated field that is given														as an example for a "Read In" file in terms of its														real and imaginary part.  It contains 64 data pair,														i.e., you can use with 64 x 64 pixel traces.														The same trace can be produced in "Theory mode",														if the following parameters are used:														Pulse width: 8														Quadr. temp. phase: -0.01														Cubic spectr. phase: 20"NIH_Image.demo" is a file generated from one of the example files that are available	             for the "NIH Image" framegrabber software. I used the "Blob" image, extracted              an 128 x 128 pixel array and exported it as "Text" format. This is not a real FROG              trace. The only intention is to show that makFROG can read this particular file              format. I you want to try to retrieve it (also it isn't meant to be retrievable), use												  Number of time delays:  128														Wavelength points:         128														Center wavelength:        600 nm														Wavelength increment:  0.2 nm														Delay increment:           40 fsIf you encounter problems with the program, please refer to these example files to check if your experimental  or read-in  files have the same syntax.
