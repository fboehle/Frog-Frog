            This is where all the real work is done.
        </p>
        <p>
            The FROG algorithms (Frogger, QiuckFROG, ...) can only handle square arrays (at the time of this
            writing) with constant delay and frequency spacing. Normally measured FROG traces are not square
            and have constant delay and wavelength spacing on their axes. Binner fixes these problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            This program is a big departure from the Femtosoft code. Femtosoft does not allow rescaling of
            the delay axis (Well the user can reduce the delay spacing by averaging time slices.). This code
            allows arbitrary rescaling of all axes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the trace is binned simply save it (for Frogger) or export it (for QuickFROG). The export
            button is the third on the toolbar (It looks like a copy button.). Exporting is a depreciated
            feature.

                This is the full time-bandwidth of the current FROG trace. This is the size of the array
                needed to represent the FROG trace without rescaling the delay axis. After binning this
                number is meaningless.

                This is the final size of the binned array. Currently an NxN matrix.

                Binned Width (%)

            <dd>
                This is a tricky parameter. This is the percentage of the binned FROG trace that the current
                FROG trace will occupy. This effectively shrinks the FROG trace and fills the extra space
                with zeros. This is useful to get the FROG trace isolated in a sea of zeros as well as
                increase the spectral resolution of the trace.

            <dd>
                When binning, how to determine the limits on the axes. The user can either fit the delay or
                frequency axis or use a fixed value for the spacing. Fitting to an axis, makes the raw FROG
                trace fit the binned trace, rescaling the axes as necessary.
            </dd>

                Delay/Frequency Spacing

            <dd>
                When fitting to an axis, these controls are indicators of the binned traces spacing. When the
                axis fit method is "Fixed," the values for the spacing are taken from these controls. The
                wavelength spacing is based at the center of the trace.
